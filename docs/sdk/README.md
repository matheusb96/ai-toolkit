# SDK documentation

This tree summarizes how to work with **`pipefy`**: the vendor GraphQL client, services, models, and queries shared by the MCP server and CLI.

## Using the library

- Import **`PipefyClient`** from `pipefy_sdk` and call facade methods; domain logic lives under `packages/sdk/src/pipefy_sdk/services/`.
- GraphQL operations are static `gql()` constants under `packages/sdk/src/pipefy_sdk/queries/` — do not build query strings dynamically.
- Pydantic input models live in `packages/sdk/src/pipefy_sdk/models/`.

For a short in-repo overview and dev commands, see **[`../../packages/sdk/README.md`](../../packages/sdk/README.md)**.

## Errors

`PipefyError` is the root of the API error types. Catch it to handle a failure
the Pipefy API reported:

```python
from pipefy_sdk import PipefyError, PipefyGraphQLError

try:
    await client.get_pipe(pipe_id)
except PipefyGraphQLError as exc:
    # exc.errors is the raw per-node error dict list, each with its own
    # message and extensions; read codes off that rather than the message text.
    codes = [(e.get("extensions") or {}).get("code") for e in exc.errors]
except PipefyError:
    # any other failure the API reported; see the carve-outs below
    ...
```

The hierarchy:

- **`PipefyError`** — root of the API error types below.
- **`PipefyAPIError`** — the API returned an error payload.
- **`PipefyGraphQLError`** — a GraphQL response carried `errors`. Subclasses `PipefyAPIError`, and carries the raw list on `.errors`. This is what most failures arrive as.

Catch the specific type before the root, since `except PipefyError` also catches
`PipefyGraphQLError` and would otherwise shadow it.

Other exported error types sit outside this root. Catch these by name:

- **`PortalPermissionError`** subclasses `ValueError`. That parentage is what
  maps a portal permission denial to CLI exit code 2 rather than 1.
- **`AttachmentUploadError`** and **`KnowledgeBaseDocumentUploadError`**
  subclass `Exception`.

Transport-level failures (connection refused, timeouts) surface as `gql`'s
`TransportError`, which the SDK does not wrap.

## Pre-write validation

Two read-only `PipefyClient` methods dry-run a write before you make it. They have the same names and parameters as the MCP tools, and they never persist anything:

- **`validate_ai_agent_behaviors(pipe_id, behaviors, *, strict_unknown_action_types=True, data_source_ids=None)`** checks a behavior list against the pipe's fields, phases, relations, phase transitions, and knowledge bases. Call it before `create_ai_agent` / `update_ai_agent`.
- **`validate_ai_automation_prompt(pipe_id, prompt, field_ids, event_id=None)`** checks the prompt's `%{internal_id}` references, the output `field_ids`, the optional trigger, and whether AI is enabled for the pipe and the organization. Call it before `create_ai_automation`.

Both return a dict. `valid` is true only when `problems` is empty, and `warnings` holds non-blocking notices. The agent result adds a `message`; the prompt result adds a `field_map` of the referenced field IDs to their labels. A failed pipe read sets `success` to false instead of raising: the agent result then gives the reason in `problems`, and the prompt result carries only `success`, `valid`, and `error`.

## Configuration

OAuth and endpoint variables are documented in **[`../config.md`](../config.md)** and **[`../../.env.example`](../../.env.example)**. Integration tests use `@pytest.mark.integration` and the same `PIPEFY_*` keys from local **`.env`** (e.g. `PIPEFY_PORTAL_ORG_UUID` for portal live tests). Unit tests use fictional ids in **[`../../packages/sdk/tests/_shared/fixture_ids.py`](../../packages/sdk/tests/_shared/fixture_ids.py)** — not production org UUIDs.

## Relationship to MCP and CLI

The SDK has **no** MCP or Typer dependencies. `pipefy-mcp-server` and `pipefy-cli` both depend on `pipefy` only. Feature parity between MCP tools and CLI commands is tracked in **[`../parity.md`](../parity.md)**.
